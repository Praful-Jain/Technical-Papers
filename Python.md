## Python Strings
- A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created,
their values cannot be changed. They support various operations such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting. Python provides a rich set of built-in string 
methods for manipulating and working with strings. Additionally, strings can be indexed and sliced to access individual characters or substrings. Python's string 
handling capabilities, combined with its simplicity and versatility, make it a powerful language for text processing and manipulation tasks.

## Python List
- A list is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets. Lists are mutable, allowing for modification after creation. They can contain elements 
of different data types and support various operations like appending, slicing, and concatenation. Python's built-in list methods enable efficient manipulation 
and organization of data, making lists an essential component for data handling in Python.

## Python tuples
- a tuple is an immutable ordered collection of elements enclosed within parentheses. Once created, the elements within a tuple cannot be changed, making tuples immutable data structures. Tuples are similar to lists, but their immutability makes them suitable for storing data that should not be changed, such as constants, coordinates, or database records. They support operations such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation, and can contain elements of different data types. With their simplicity and reliability, tuples are useful for tasks that require the preservation of data integrity and immutability.
