# Python
- Python is a high-level, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.
- Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.

## Features of python:

- Free and Open Source.
- Easy to code
- Easy to Read
- Object-Oriented Language
- GUI Programming Support
- High-Level Language
- Large Community Support

## Python Strings
- A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single, double, or triple quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created,
their values cannot be changed. They support various operations such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting. Python provides a rich set of built-in string 
methods for manipulating and working with strings. Additionally, strings can be indexed and sliced to access individual characters or substrings. Python's string 
handling capabilities, combined with its simplicity and versatility, make it a powerful language for text processing and manipulation tasks.

## Python Lists
- A list is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets. Lists are mutable, allowing for modification after creation. They can contain elements 
of different data types and support various operations like appending, slicing, and concatenation. Python's built-in list methods enable efficient manipulation 
and organization of data, making lists an essential component for data handling in Python.

## Python Tuples
- A tuple is an immutable ordered collection of elements enclosed within parentheses. Once created, the elements within a tuple cannot be changed, making tuples immutable data structures. Tuples are similar to lists, but their immutability makes them suitable for storing data that should not be changed, such as constants, coordinates, or database records. They support operations such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation, and can contain elements of different data types. With their simplicity and reliability, tuples are useful for tasks that require the preservation of data integrity and immutability.

## Python Sets
- A set is an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces. Sets are mutable, allowing for the addition and removal of items, but they cannot contain duplicates. They support operations such as intersection, union, and difference, making them useful for tasks involving unique elements and eliminating duplicates from other collections. With their efficient membership testing and unique properties, sets are valuable for handling data that requires uniqueness and mathematical operations

## Python Dictionary
- A dictionary is a mutable collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Dictionaries allow for the addition, modification, and deletion of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type and can be duplicated. Dictionaries support efficient data organization and retrieval based on keys, making them valuable for mapping relationships between keys and associated values in a structured and flexible manne

## Python Functions

1) In-built Functions
   - These are the functions present in python libraries.
   - eg: int(), str(), bool(), len(), print(), etc.
2) User Defined Functions
